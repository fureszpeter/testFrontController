# Competency test

## PFB assignment.

- Create a basic controller for viewing and editing Users.
- All code must be fully testable and mockable.
- The controller should have no idea where the data is stored (meaning it can be changed) as discussed in Interview call.
- For maximum performance, controllers should only receive the data they needâ€”no extra fields. Implementation should 
leverage some type of ***data mapper*** functionality.
- Please note code should adhere design principals , PSR and OOPS Patterns.
